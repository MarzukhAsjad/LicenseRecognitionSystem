# LicenseRecognitionSystem
Creating a License recognition system using python. So far until part 4 has been made. Part 5 still needs work (basically converting actual letters and numbers to text). For now the current AI detects license number of a sample image. You can replace img.jpg with any other image of a car with a license plate (just keep the filename same though because the path is hardcoded for now).

The dependencies can be installed in a virtual environment (preferred) or your local environment of choice.
Installation of dependencies via the following command in python terminal: <br>
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
