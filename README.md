# LicenseRecognitionSystem
Creating a License recognition system using python. So far until part 4 has been made. Part 5 still needs work (basically training for all files). For now the current AI detects license number.

The dependencies can be installed in a virtual environment (preferred) or your local environment of choice.
Installation of dependencies via the following command in python terminal: <br>
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
